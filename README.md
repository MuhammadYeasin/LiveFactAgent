LiveFactAgent
LiveFactAgent is a real-time fact-checking AI agent built for the Perplexity Hackathon 2025. It processes live speech, transcribes it using Whisper, extracts claims with spaCy, and verifies them using Perplexityâ€™s Sonar API via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). Deployed on Vercel with a Streamlit frontend, it delivers instant fact-checks for debates, speeches, or podcasts, combating misinformation on the fly.
